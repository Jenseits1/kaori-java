# ðŸŽ» Kaori - Programming Language

**Kaori** is an interpreted statically typed programming language built with **Java 17**

## Features

-   **Statically Typed**  
    Enforces type safety for predictable, and faster runtimes

-   **Detailed Error Messages**  
    Developer-friendly diagnostics for syntax and runtime issues

-   **Implemented Language Features**

    -   [x] Variable declaration (`x: f64 = 10;`, `x: bool = true;`, `x: str = "Hello world";`)
    -   [x] Assign operators (`x = 5;`)
    -   [x] Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
    -   [x] Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
    -   [x] Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
    -   [x] Postfix operators (`++`, `--`)
    -   [x] `if / else` statements
    -   [x] `for` loops
    -   [x] `while` loops
    -   [x] Block statements for scope (`{ ... }`)
    -   [x] Output with `print` statements
    -   [ ] Functions
    -   [ ] Native data structures (e.g., lists, maps)
    -   [ ] Bytecode generation
    -   [ ] Classes and inheritance

## Technologies Used

-   **Java 17** â€” The entire interpreter is written in modern Java
-   **Maven / Gradle** â€” Dependency and build management

## Grammar

```text
program                  -> statement* EOF

statement                -> expr_stmt
                         | print_stmt
                         | block_stmt
                         | if_stmt
                         | while_stmt
                         | for_stmt
                         | return_stmt
                         | variable_stmt

function_stmt            -> "def" identifier "(" we ";"

expr_stmt                -> expression ";"

block_stmt               -> "{" statement* "}"

variable_stmt            -> identifier ":" type = expression ";"

print_stmt               -> "print" "(" expression ")" ";"

if_stmt                  -> "if" expression block_stmt ("else" (if_stmt | block_stmt))?

while_stmt               -> "while" expression block_stmt

for_stmt                 -> "for" variable_stmt ";" expression ";" expression block_stmt

expression               -> assign | or ";"

assign                   -> identifier "=" assignment

logic_or                 -> logic_and ("||" logic_and)*

logic_and                -> equality ("&&" equality)*

equality                 -> comparison (("!=" | "==") comparison)*

comparison               -> term ((">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=") term)*

term                     -> factor (("+" | "-") factor)*

factor                   -> unary (("*" | "/") unary)*

prefix_unary             -> ("!" | "-") unary | primary

primary                  -> number | string | boolean | postfix_unary | "(" expression ")"

postfix_unary            -> identifier ("++" | "--")?
```
