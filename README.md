# ðŸŽ» Kaori - Programming Language

**Kaori** is an interpreted statically typed programming language built with **Java 17**

## Features

-   **Statically Typed**  
    Enforces type safety for predictable, and faster runtimes

-   **Detailed Error Messages**  
    Developer-friendly diagnostics for syntax and runtime issues

-   **Implemented Language Features**

    -   [x] Variable declaration (`x: f64 = 10;`, `x: bool = true;`, `x: str = "Hello world";`)
    -   [x] Assign operators (`x = 5;`)
    -   [x] Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
    -   [x] Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
    -   [x] Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
    -   [x] Postfix operators (`++`, `--`)
    -   [x] `if / else` statements
    -   [x] `for` loops
    -   [x] `while` loops
    -   [x] block_statement statements for scope (`{ ... }`)
    -   [x] Output with `print` statements
    -   [x] Code comments (`/* this is a comment */`)
    -   [x] Functions
    -   [ ] Native data structures (e.g., lists, maps)
    -   [ ] Bytecode generation
    -   [ ] Classes and inheritance

## Technologies Used

-   **Java 17** â€” The entire interpreter is written in modern Java
-   **Maven / Gradle** â€” Dependency and build management

## Grammar

```text
program                  -> declaration* EOF

type                     -> function_type | primitive_type
primitive_type           -> bool | f64 | str
function_type            -> ( [type [, type]*] ) -> type

declaration              -> variable_declaration
                         | function_declaration | statement

variable_declaration     -> identifier : type = expression ;

function_declaration     -> def identifier ( [variable_declaration*] ) : type block_statement

statement                -> expression_statement
                         | print_statement
                         | if_statement
                         | while_statement
                         | for_statement
                         | block_statement

expression_statement     -> expression ;

print_statement          -> print ( expression ) ;

if_statement             -> if expression block_statement [else [if_statement | block_statement]]?

while_statement          -> while expression block_statement

for_statement            -> for variable_declaration ; expression ; expression block_statement

block_statement          -> { declaration* }

expression               -> assignment | logic_or

assignment               -> identifier = expression

logic_or                 -> logic_and [|| logic_and]*

logic_and                -> equality [&& equality]*

equality                 -> comparison [[!= | ==] comparison]*

comparison               -> term [[> | >= | < | <=] term]*

term                     -> factor [[+ | -] factor]*

factor                   -> prefix_unary [[* | /] prefix_unary]*

prefix_unary             -> [! | -] unary | primary

primary                  -> number_literal
                         | string_literal
                         | boolean_literal
                         | postfix_unary
                         | ( expression )

postfix_unary            -> [identifier [++ | --]? | function_call]

function_call             -> callee [(expression [, expression]*)]*
```
