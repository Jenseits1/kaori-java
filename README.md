# ðŸŽ» Kaori - Programming Language

Kaori is a statically typed programming language originally built with Java 17
Note: This Java implementation version is now discontinued. Kaori is currently being rewritten in Rust

## Technologies Used

-   **Java 17** â€” The entire interpreter is written in modern Java
-   **Maven / Gradle** â€” Dependency and build management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Java 17+
-   Maven or Gradle (recommended for building)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kaori-lang.git
    cd kaori-lang
    ```

2. Build the project with Maven:

    ```bash
    mvn package
    ```

    Or with Gradle:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew build
    ```

3. Run the REPL:

    ```bash
    java -jar target/kaori.jar
    ```

## Running Scripts

To run a `.kaori` script:

```bash
java -jar target/kaori.jar path/to/script.kaori
```

To enter the interactive mode (REPL):

```bash
java -jar target/kaori.jar
```

## ðŸ’– Name Inspiration

The name Kaori is inspired by the character Kaori Miyazono from the anime "Your Lie in April". She represents inspiration, motivation, and the desire to create something different from the standard â€” the same spirit behind creating this language
